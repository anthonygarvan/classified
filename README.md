# Classified

## What is this?
This is a static web app that performs classification on a CSV you upload.

It has a simple flow:
1. Upload CSV 
2. Define data types and target values for columns
3. Classify and view results

## Why should this exist?

The idea behind this is that there is a lot of data out there that could 
probably be predicted with simple classifiers, but the barriers are too 
high to access those models- they require either in-depth knowledge of 
mathematics and programming, or very high cost. 

And yet, even with expensive tools or years of training, it is often the 
case that the best results are obtained by following a few simple rules 
of thumb. 

Moreover, it is often difficult for analysts to get access to the data in
the first place, leading to a lengthy and expensive process of data transfer.
I work in government now, so it may even be classified (hence the clever name).
Yet I still want to make sure that everyone who can export a csv from excel 
can run some simple machine learning algorithms on it.
